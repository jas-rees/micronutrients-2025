In this directory, there are example scripts used in the simulation analysis.
Unless specified otherwise, these are given for simulated selection at 1kya in the simulated African population.

In this directory:
1) burn_in.slim {slim script for burn-in}
2) tree_simulation_selected_example.slim {slim script for initiating selection at 1kya in the African population}
3) tree_simulation_neutral.slim {slim script with no selection, used in the generation of neutral distributions}
4) statistics_example.sh {examples of scripts used to calculate statistics, all given for simulated selection at 1kya in the simulated African population.}
5) identifying_signatures_relate_example.py {python script for calculating position of test statistic of each SNP in tail, given for Relate}
6) sumstat.sh {example bash script for selecting top snps and summing into gene sets, can then be compared to neutral gene sets as outlined in 5)}.
