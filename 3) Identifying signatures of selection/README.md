In this directory, these scripts detail the calculation and analysis of MA-genes (see meta-data) and HGDP data.
Brief description of included scripts:

1) FST.sh (calculation of SNP-FST)
2) Relate.sh (generation of genealogies and calculation of selection values; see https://myersgroup.github.io/relate/)
3) empirical_pvalues.R (example R scripts to calculate empirical p-values)
4) top_snps.sh (example bash script to isolate top-SNPs in MA-genes)
5) sumstat_all_micros.py (example python script to sum the pvalues of top-ranking SNPs over all MA-genes)
6) sumstat_individual_micros.py (example python script to sum the pvalues of top-ranking SNPs over individual MA-sets)
7) sumstat_individual_micros_without_overlap.py (example python script to sum the pvalues of top-ranking SNPs over individual MA-sets, with edited MA-gene sets with no overlap)
8) sumstat_neutral.sh (pipeline to generate SUMSTAT values from background genes, to be used in comparison)
9) CLUES2.sh (pipeline to run CLUES2; see https://github.com/avaughn271/CLUES2)
